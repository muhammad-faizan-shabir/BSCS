For this phase, you are required to use the same syntax analysis code you developed earlier. Carefully place translation
rules only where necessary within the provided grammar subset.  Please remember that the output of this phase relies
on all the previous phases you have implemented yourself.  A  *.cpp file will be given as input, and your program should
generate a  *.tac (Three Address Code) file as output.
