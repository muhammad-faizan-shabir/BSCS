Instructions:

For Project Phase 1 (Lexical Analysis), you are required to submit the following files:
1. An Excel file (lexer_your_roll_number.xlsx) containing the transition table of the Finite Automaton (FA) (as submitted
in Assignment 1).
2. A source code file named lexer_your_roll_number.cpp, which implements your lexical analyzer.
3. A demonstration video named LexerDemo_your_roll_number.mp4. 
4. Additionally, create a file and include appropriate test code in it. A file named Symbol_Table_your_roll_number.txt,
which must list all identifiers and relevant words along with their positional attributes.
5. A file named Literal_Table_your_roll_number.txt, which should contain only string literals.
6. Keywords may be handled according to your specified FA design.
7. A file named Error_your_roll_number.txt, which must record all lexical errors encountered.

Note:
You must complete this phase individually. You are permitted to use basic built-in functions only. For instance, you may
utilize data structures such as stacks and heaps. However, high-level functions like string tokenizers are not allowed. 
To achieve full credit, aim to implement the solution using the most fundamental code possible.

Important:
If your code is found to be plagiarized or generated with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs), you will
receive for this phase. Moreover, late submission is not allowed at all.

Best of luck!

Special Instruction:
You must use an Input Buffer (IB) pair, with each buffer having a size of 25 characters. Avoid storing the entire
source code in a single array.
Moreover, Ensure the code handles both single-line and multi-line comments. Additionally, condense multiple
consecutive white spaces into a single space.
Create a "Meow" category to manage these modifications.
