Please find attached the template you can use to make the UI Design
Document. Make the GUIs for your course project. You can use any tool
to make the GUI (Figma is recommended, but no additional marks for using
it or penalty for not using it). You may search the internet for free
software tools to make user interface design, e.g. Figma, AdobeXD, 
JustinMind, etc.
