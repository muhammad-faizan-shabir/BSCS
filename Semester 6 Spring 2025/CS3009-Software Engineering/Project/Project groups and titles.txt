The project is to develop a software from inception till delivery. You can choose to make a web application or a mobile 
app, as per your preference. No restriction on the choice of technology. Try to choose a unique idea, and the scope 
should be suitable for a term project.

group leads  are allowed to edit the file. Follow the instructions below:

Dear class, work in harmony on this file. All the best! Kindly fill this file by Thursday, 6th February. Groups of two and 
two will be  merged together.

Cross section groups are not allowed. Only a couple of students were allowed to attend cross section classes due to 
clashes. They can make a group with the section they attend classes with.
