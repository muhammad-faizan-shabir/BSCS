Design the architecture of your course project's system, by
choosing the most appropriate architecture style(s). Justify the choice
of architecture that you make. You can use a combination of the architectural styles too. Name your document 
Software Architecture Document (SAD). Your
submission will contain an architecture diagram (using functional
decomposition and the sources taught in class), your refined class diagram and a component diagram (showing all
the internal and external interfaces using UML 2.0 notation)
